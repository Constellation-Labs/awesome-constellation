### Wait, there's more ...

This repository provides links to information within the Constellation ecosystem, the primary target audience being software developers and community contributors. 
As of today (October 2018), our core focus is on developing the protocol. To deep dive into the reference implementation, check out the docs.
If you want to understand how Constellation fits into the crypto space at large, the wiki might be the place to start.

## The DAG Token

DAG is currently an ERC20 token on the 
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) 
blockchain and, as such, supported by various Ethereum wallets. You'll find support on the #support channel on the 
[discord](https://discordapp.com/) 
server. Lots of information about the token has been posted on the 
[official blog](https://constellationlabs.io/blog/) 
on the official homepage.

### Wallets

## Design

### Visual Identity

The 
[/visual-identity](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/visual-identity)
repository holds hundrets of graphics material for the Constellation brand. See e.g. the
[/logo](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/visual-identity/tree/master/logo) 
folder. Here is 
[a video](https://community.constellationlabs.io/t/a-video-analyzing-and-quickly-scripting-the-constellation-logo-using-python/1942)
explaining the specification of the latter.

### Merchandise

If you look for basic branded items, the [cryptothings](https://cryptothings.store/product-category/constellation/) store sells some.
